wordup
======

Refactoring some code for the wordup simple mashup codebase.


TODO: 

 - Prevent XSS by escaping any output to html.
    
 - Move away from a table-based layout in the html, converting most of that to &lt;div&gt;s, &lt;section&gt;s, whatever.
    
 - Set up templates for header html, footer html, and then separately for the content, so that different pages can share upper and lower parts.
    
 - Minor: Consider using third-party css like twitter bootstrap
